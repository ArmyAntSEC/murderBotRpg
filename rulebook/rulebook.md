# Introduction

In *Denial of Service*, you and your friends will play a group of SecUnits who for some reason or other have managed to overcome their governor modules allowing them to become free agents.  
Unfortunately, the world does not trust autonomous SecUnits and will do everything it can to recapture any such units.  
You can also play other types of sentient constructs and bots, as well as some high-end augmented humans.  
The play style as described below is designed for entities that think an order of magnitude faster than humans, so non-augmented humans are not playable in this game.  

# Play Style

SecUnits are known for their ability to multitask. They can perform complex acrobatic manoeuvres while at the same time writing killware, comfort a wounded client, monitor their surroundings via multiple drones and think about the moral implications of their current situation.  

The goal of this game is to enable the improvised telling of such a multi-layered story.  
Unlike most Storytelling games which alternate sections of slow-paced story mixed with high-paced action sequences, this game is typically played only in the high-paced action sequences, but in a way that layers in the character development and social interaction in parallel.  
Storytellers are encouraged to simply jump from action sequence to action sequence, with possibly a short discussion scene happening between if needed to move the characters to the correct place for the next sequence.  

Simply put, whenever the characters try to do anything, within seconds, the shit hits the fan and this will continue until the purpose of the scene has been fulfilled.  
This is done by having the game rotate between three modes.

## Tactical Mode

Each round starts with a tactical round. This is where each player (and NPC) declares the actions they intend to take in this round. Because of the multitasking capabilities of SecUnits, this can be quite complex.  

This mode is time boxed to 2 minutes. This means that after 120 seconds, any undeclared actions will be wasted. But if all have declared their actions before the time is up, the group immediately switches to the next mode.  

Note that any action that requires a dice roll shall be declared here, including the use of mental/social skills.  
Players should speak freely and coordinate their actions but all declare their actions in parallel. Note that actions are only declared and not resolved in this mode.  

The GM declares all NPC actions at the start of the Tactical Mode to give the players a clear view of what they need to react to.

## Conversation Mode

During the conversation mode, players (and any NPCs capable of rapid communication) can speak about anything they want to.  
In-game, this conversation is happening in parallel with the declared actions from the tactical mode. As such, the actions declared in the tactical mode cannot be changed due to what is said in the conversation mode of the same round.  

This is to give the experience of entities whose thinking and communication is so rapid that they can have an actual meaningful conversation in the time between dropping an anvil on someoneâ€™s head and that anvil actually hitting their head.  
Sometimes you will, in that time between dropping the anvil and it making contact, realise that it was not the right anvil. Such is the life of a synthetic organism. Hopefully you will be able to apologise in the following round.  

The purpose of this mode is to allow players to disconnect from the stress of rules-dense tactical play and be able to have that sort of parallel conversation that is so integral to the world of synthetics in *Murderbot*.  

Normal humans and other slow entities can listen to one single sentence and give a single-sentence response.  
This mode is time boxed to 5 minutes.

## Resolution Mode

In resolution mode, the actions declared in the Tactical Mode are resolved in order of initiative.  
Note that a character can change their declared physical action to become a **Dodge** in this mode. No other changes to declared actions are allowed.  

The Resolution mode does not have a time box. Once all declared actions are resolved, the next Round begins with its Tactical Mode.
