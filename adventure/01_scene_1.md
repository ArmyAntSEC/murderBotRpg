# ðŸ›  Scene: Field Extraction (Rounds 1â€“12)

## Round 1
*Dust swirls in the oppressive heat as the clients step onto the ledge encircling the neural bulb â€” a pale, swollen mass half-submerged in the sand, its surface veined with flickering bioluminescence. The ATV idles below on the basin floor, its hatch open and sensors twitching nervously. One SecUnit stands in its shadow, scanning the rocks. Another crouches on a jagged outcropping, overlooking the site. A third remains near the top of the bulb, rifle resting on the rail, tracking motion through a lens. As the first client descends the slope with a containment case, a tremor ripples through the crust â€” faint, but wrong.*


**Hard Move:**
Success Criteria: Two characters do successful offensive moves

A sandcrawler explodes from beneath the surface, jagged mandibles clamping down on the lead client. Blood spatters the containment case as the creature thrashes backward, dragging its prey into the sand with a shriek before they both dissappear.

## Round 2
*For a moment, all is still but for the hum of the ATV and the wind against the rock spires. Then â€” movement. A ridge of churned sand.*

**Hard move:**
Sample Success: Two characters do successful offensive moves

The sand crawler bursts forth again, jaws wide, and slams into the most threatening figure â€” crushing limbs and pinning them under its weight. 

2-harm (grappling). They are trapped until pulled free or the creature is forced off.

## Round 3
*A keening cry splits the air â€” high, metallic, almost electronic. The sandcrawlerâ€™s head rears back, twitching. From the far side of the basin, another mound of sand begins to rise.*

**Hard move:**
Sample Success: One character must draw attention or inflict heavy damage

A second crawler erupts in a spray of grit and stone, flanking the group. Its initial strike is surgical â€” a blinding pounce meant to disarm or disable the distracted. It attacks the SecUnit who has done most damage so far.

3-harm (piercing or disarming). The target drops or loses use of one carried item (weapon, drone, gear).

## Round 4
*The basin floor rumbles â€” subtly at first, then with a low, rhythmic thump beneath the ATVâ€™s wheels. Its suspension shifts unevenly. On the console: a silent alert. **Terrain stability warning: Chassis torque nearing limit.** Something under the sand is collapsing.*

**Hard move:**
Sample Success: ATV must be reinforced, rerouted, or weight reduced

The ATV lurches sideways into a depression â€” frame twisted, front wheels half-buried. Any unsecured gear or passengers are thrown (1-harm, disoriented). The vehicle is immobilized until stabilized or winched out.

## Round 5
*Shadows roll across the basin as something blots out the sun. It descends like a wound torn in the sky: sleek and serpentine, black as memory, glimmering with impossible lights that slide across its surface like thought. Tendrils trail behind it, laced with arcs of static and iridescent motes. The sandcrawler recoils, half-buried. Even the second one freezes. For a moment, nothing dares move.

Then the Sky Dragon screams â€” not sound, but pressure. A wave that fractures stone and cracks visors.*

**Hard move:**
Sample Success: Two successful Armour Piercing attacks. 

The Sky Dragon arcs low, trailing a storm-field that tears the slope loose beneath the group. The ATV lists, half-swallowed by the collapsing edge. As the dust and debris rain down, a tendril of the Sky Dragon lashes out with lightning speed â€” snatching a second client from the ledge and hauling them into the storm-cloud, their desperate cries swallowed by the roar.

## Round 6
*The ground trembles beneath your feet as the Sky Dragonâ€™s storm-cloud looms overhead, crackling with electric menace. Behind you, the snarls and swish of the sandcrawlers grow louder in the swirling dust. The path back to the research base is a gauntlet of unstable terrain and fractured rock.*

**Hard Move**
Sample Success: Successful drive and diversion 

The collapsing slope shifts again â€” a jagged crack opens beneath them. They barely avoid it, but a fall is inevitable if they slip again (2-harm, prone).
